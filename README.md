# search.sh

A command line search multi-tool. search.sh provides a common interface
for both local file and full text searches, as well as web searches.

## Local search

The local search commands are a set of commands that wrap common
operations of locally-installed search utilities with uniform command
line argument structures.

## Web search engines

search.sh includes commands for searching each of the major internet
search engines and will default to opening the resulting search results
page in your terminal browser, if one is installed.

## Site-specific search

Also included are several commands for performing searches on various
sites, like YouTube and Wikipedia.
